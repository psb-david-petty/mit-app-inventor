Sample MIT App Inventor projects

| Link | Description |
|---|---|
| [./APCSPStroopExample](./APCSPStroopExample) | The `APCSPStroopExample`app illustrates all aspects of the [APCS-P](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf) requirements for the [Create Performance Task](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf):<br>• List storing and access used to manage the complexity of the program;<br>• A procedure w/ a parameter that is called from different places with different values and whose behavior varies based on the value of the parameter; and<br>• An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and repetition. |
| [./BlankTemplate](./BlankTemplate) | The `BlankTemplate` app is a template for *any* [MIT App Inventor](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/) app. |
| [./CaesarVigenereCipherTemplate](./CaesarVigenereCipherTemplate) | The `CaesarVigenereCipherTemplate` app template is an enhancement to the APCSP Mobile [6.5](https://course.mobilecsp.org/mobilecsp/unit?unit=25&lesson=173) [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) app that includes a [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenère_cipher). |
| [./ImageSize](./ImageSize) | The `ImageSize` app demonstrates the delay between changing the size of an `Image` or `Canvas` and the dimensions actually changing. |
| [./RecursionTemplate](./RecursionTemplate) | The `RecursionTemplate` app is a template for implementing recursive functions to calulate *factorial*, *Fibonacci number*, and *combinations*. |
| [./Reorient](./Reorient) | The `Reorient` app demonstrates the delay between changing the `Screen1` orientation and the `Screen1` dimensions actually changing. |
| [./SecretWord](./SecretWord) | The `SecretWord` app is a speech-recognition app that mirrors the *secret word* of **[You Bet Your Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Bet_Your_Life)** (1950&ndash;1960) with Groucho Marx. |
